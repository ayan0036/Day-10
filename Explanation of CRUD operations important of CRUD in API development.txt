1-What are CRUD operations? 

ANS:CRUD stands for: 

Create → Add new data 

Read → Retrieve existing data 

Update → Modify existing data

These are the four basic functions required to manage data in any application. 


 Importance of CRUD in API Development: 

CRUD operations are the backbone of any RESTful API. They allow clients to: 

Interact with the server's data 

Maintain consistency and flow of data 

Perform all necessary database actions through standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
